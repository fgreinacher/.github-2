# Useful templates for project workspaces

## Purpose

Here you'll find an overview about some useful templates for project workspaces you can find on our SIMATIC AX GitHub Community. Each project template contains workflow/project type-specific definitions and scripts, so they don't have to be recreated each time.

[More information regarding templates, you'll find here](https://console.simatic-ax.siemens.io/docs/apax/templates)

These templates can be used for:

- new github-ax-community repositories
- base for new user defined templates
