# Code-Snippets

## Purpose

Code-Snippets are intended to help the user to easily paste specific code-snippets into your files. We recommend to add the snippets-package(s) into your apax.yml - devDependencies. More code-snippets will be added here over time.

These snippets can be used for:

- include repeatable code-sections into your project fast
- standardize sourcecode -behaviour/-creation
